Home page for the DSD Course and the DSD-Python organization

Everything we do in this organization will be an experiment! 

The file ids.psv is a leftover from an experiment in the first course. The extension ".psv" suggests "pipe separated values." It is like "comma separated values" but with the pipe (or vertical line) as the separator. 

The file names.txt is the one you should edit. To do this, click on the pencil in the web view. It will tell you that you can't edit the file so you will need to 'fork' the repository. Go ahead, edit the file to add your github ide after the pipe that follows your name. When you are done, "Commit your change" which is the same as saving. Then follow the instructions for making a pull request. 

Let's see if git can merge togehter a bunch of edits to the same file by different people if those edits are on different lines of the file.
