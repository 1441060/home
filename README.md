Everything we do in this organization will be an experiment! 

The file called ids.psv is pipe delimited. I tried naming this ids.csv but github barked at me because the file had no commas. So .psv it is. It has these fields: 

- publickey - if you add a line to this file and don't know your public key, enter TBA. Avoid unnecessary spaces.   
- github-id - your github id. Avoid unnecessary spaces.   
- fullname - your full name. Spaces allowed but please avoid trailing and leading spaces. 
- info - Use this only if it is necessary to uniquely identify yourself. For example, if there are two people named John William Smith, provide something else such as your BC email that will make it possible to know who you are.
